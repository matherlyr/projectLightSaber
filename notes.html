We have two drill downs/organize. A user can sort the data in the table using any row he/she desires. Also, a user can choose to see only movies directed by George Lucas if desired. 
In addition our CSS is usable and looks like you are in a Start Wars movie, so it is very professional and useable for users of our website.  We did not go beyond our simple website design
to include other webpages or incorporate a new data set.
